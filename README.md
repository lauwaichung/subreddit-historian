# subreddit-historian: Statistical Analysis of Subreddits

Objective Statement:

Subreddit Historian aims to help people to better understand subreddits they are interested in through statistical analysis.
There are so many ways this can be done, and we aim to be thorough. First we will start with compiling simple statistics like vocabulary usage, reading level, most upvoted or downvoted words and phrases. Ultimately, we would like to produce an analysis of a subreddits major concerns, typical interactions, exceptional events, and changes over time.
